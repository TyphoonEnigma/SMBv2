Below you will find a comprehensive guide to obtaining, building, and examining a real SMBv2 server (via the Samba project) rather than a toy “SMBv2-like” example. Since Samba is an open-source implementation of SMB/CIFS (including SMBv2 and SMBv3) and is the de facto standard on most UNIX/Linux systems, it is the closest we have to a “real SMBv2 server” codebase you can study, modify, and even reverse-engineer with Ghidra.

	Important Notes
		1.	The entire Samba codebase is massive—tens (or hundreds) of thousands of lines. We cannot feasibly paste the full code into a single response here.
	2.	Samba is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPLv3), which means you are free to study, modify, and share it under the same license.
	3.	This answer will show you how to get the complete, real SMBv2 server (Samba), where to find the relevant SMBv2 server logic, and how to reverse-engineer it (e.g., in Ghidra).
	4.	For the latest updates in or around 2025, you would clone from the official Samba Git repository’s newest branch/release.

Below is the structured roadmap:

1. Obtaining and Building the Latest Samba (Real SMBv2)

1.1 Download the Samba Source Code

Samba hosts its official Git repository on Samba’s GitLab and also mirrors on GitHub. For the latest code (which would presumably include all current SMBv2 and SMBv3 updates circa 2025), you would typically do:

# Make sure you have git installed
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y git

# Clone the Samba repository (master branch)
git clone https://gitlab.com/samba-team/samba.git samba-latest
cd samba-latest

(If you’re actually in the year 2025, you might want to check out the latest stable tag or release branch that Samba provides, e.g., v4.xx.x or similar.)

1.2 Install Build Dependencies

Samba requires multiple development libraries and tools. On Debian/Ubuntu-like systems, you often need:

sudo apt-get install -y build-essential python3 python3-dev python3-pip \
    libacl1-dev libattr1-dev libblkid-dev libldap2-dev libldb-dev \
    libreadline-dev perl gdb pkg-config

(There are many more optional dependencies if you want certain features like AD DC support.)

1.3 Configure and Compile Samba

In the Samba source tree:

# 1) Bootstrap (if needed)
./buildtools/bin/waf configure --disable-python

# 2) Configure the build with typical defaults
./configure --enable-debug

# 3) Compile
make -j$(nproc)

# 4) (Optional) Install to /usr/local/samba or another prefix
#    Not strictly required if you just want to run it from the build dir
sudo make install

This process takes a while. When complete, you will have the real SMB server (smbd) and associated binaries built for your system.

2. Locating the Core SMBv2 Server Logic in Samba

Samba organizes its code in multiple directories:
	•	source3/ — Contains most of the classic file server (smbd) code.
	•	source4/ — Contains code for the Active Directory Domain Controller functionality, among others.

For SMB2/SMB3 server request handling, the key code paths are in source3/smbd/smb2_*.c. Examples:
	1.	source3/smbd/smb2_server.c – The main SMB2/3 server dispatch logic.
	2.	source3/smbd/smb2_read.c – Handling of SMB2 READ requests.
	3.	source3/smbd/smb2_write.c – Handling of SMB2 WRITE requests.
	4.	source3/smbd/smb2_ioctl.c, etc.

Below is a very small excerpt from smb2_server.c in Samba (modern versions) to give you a sense of how it looks. (Again, the full file is large—hundreds of lines—and we cannot paste it all here. You can view it locally after cloning.)

/* 
   This is a partial snippet to illustrate how Samba dispatches SMB2 commands.

*/

NTSTATUS smbd_smb2_request_dispatch(struct smbd_smb2_request *req)
{
    NTSTATUS status = NT_STATUS_OK;
    switch (req->hdr.AsyncId.Command) {
    case SMB2_NEGOTIATE:
        status = smbd_smb2_negotiate(req);
        break;
    case SMB2_SESSION_SETUP:
        status = smbd_smb2_session_setup(req);
        break;
    case SMB2_TREE_CONNECT:
        status = smbd_smb2_tree_connect(req);
        break;
    case SMB2_LOGOFF:
        status = smbd_smb2_logoff(req);
        break;
    case SMB2_CREATE:
        status = smbd_smb2_create(req);
        break;
    case SMB2_CLOSE:
        status = smbd_smb2_close(req);
        break;
    case SMB2_FLUSH:
        status = smbd_smb2_flush(req);
        break;
    case SMB2_READ:
        status = smbd_smb2_read(req);
        break;
    case SMB2_WRITE:
        status = smbd_smb2_write(req);
        break;
    case SMB2_IOCTL:
        status = smbd_smb2_ioctl(req);
        break;
    // ... many more ...
    default:
        DEBUG(1,("Unknown SMB2 command 0x%x\n", req->hdr.AsyncId.Command));
        status = NT_STATUS_NOT_IMPLEMENTED;
        break;
    }

    return status;
}

In real Samba, you’ll see:
	•	Strict validation of fields (structure sizes, offsets, lengths).
	•	Session and authentication logic (NTLM, Kerberos, SPNEGO).
	•	Signing / Encryption logic for SMB3.
	•	A huge variety of commands beyond READ/WRITE.

Unlike the toy “SMBv2-like” code, Samba does not have a hidden 0xFFFF “backdoor” command. Instead, it carefully enumerates known SMB2/3 commands, returning NT_STATUS_NOT_IMPLEMENTED or NT_STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER for anything unexpected.

3. Running the Real Samba SMBv2 Server

Once built and installed:
	1.	Create a Samba configuration (e.g., /usr/local/samba/etc/smb.conf):

[global]
    workgroup = WORKGROUP
    server string = Samba Server
    netbios name = MYSERVER
    security = user
    map to guest = Bad User
    # Force use of SMB2 (disable SMB1)
    server min protocol = SMB2_02
    server max protocol = SMB3

[public]
    path = /srv/samba/public
    public = yes
    guest ok = yes
    writable = yes


	2.	Start smbd (and nmbd if needed):

sudo /usr/local/samba/sbin/smbd -D
sudo /usr/local/samba/sbin/nmbd -D

Or run them in the foreground for debugging:

sudo /usr/local/samba/sbin/smbd -i -d3


	3.	Connect to the share from a Windows or Linux SMB client. You’ll be using real SMB2 or SMB3, not the toy protocol.

4. Analyzing Samba with Ghidra (or Other Tools)

If you want to reverse-engineer the real Samba server the way an attacker or researcher might, you can do the following:
	1.	Disable Stripping of Symbols
	•	When building Samba, keep debug symbols by passing --enable-debug.
	•	This way Ghidra will have more information about function names, etc.
	2.	Locate the smbd Binary
	•	Typically ends up in bin/default/source3/smbd/smbd (depending on your build).
	•	Or if installed: /usr/local/samba/sbin/smbd.
	3.	Import into Ghidra
	•	File → New Project → “Non-Shared Project,” choose a directory.
	•	File → Import File → select the smbd binary.
	•	Click “Yes” to analyze.
	4.	Search for SMBv2 functions
	•	In the Ghidra Symbol Tree or Functions window, look for symbols like smbd_smb2_request_dispatch(), smbd_smb2_read(), etc.
	•	Double-click to see the decompiled code. Ghidra often does a good job labeling parameters, etc.
	5.	Study Security Mechanisms
	•	You’ll find code for signing, encryption, permission checks, etc.
	•	You’ll see how Samba handles malicious or malformed requests (unlike our toy example, it usually fails gracefully).

5. Why Real Samba Doesn’t Have the Toy “Backdoor”

In the earlier “SMBv2-like” examples, we deliberately inserted:
	•	A hidden command ID (0xFFFF) that overwrote a function pointer.
	•	No boundary checks on the payload.
	•	Minimal or no real security checks.

Real Samba (and real SMB2/3) does rigorous checks:
	1.	Command Validation: The SMB2 command field can only be certain valid values (e.g., SMB2_READ = 0x0008, SMB2_WRITE = 0x0009, etc.).
	2.	Structure Sizes: Samba enforces correct structure sizes (e.g., StructureSize must match SMB2 spec).
	3.	Buffer Boundaries: Samba carefully checks the lengths of incoming data before copying.
	4.	No Hidden Commands: Samba’s development process and open-source nature help ensure no “secret debug” commands remain lurking in production code.

Thus, an overflow-based RCE exploit or “function pointer overwrite” scenario is far less likely in a properly maintained real SMBv2 server such as Samba.

6. Summary and Final Warnings
	1.	Real SMBv2/3: Use Samba for a fully featured, real implementation of modern SMB protocols (including SMBv2.1, SMB3.x).
	2.	Large Codebase: Samba is huge; you’ll want to focus on source3/smbd/ for the file server portion.
	3.	No Backdoor: Samba doesn’t have a simplistic hidden RCE trick the way our toy code does. Instead, it’s a robust server with security checks.
	4.	Ghidra/Reverse-Engineering: You can open the compiled smbd in Ghidra to see how real SMB commands are parsed and dispatched.
	5.	GPL License: Samba is GPLv3; you’re free to modify and share under the same terms.
	6.	Hardening: Even with Samba, consider enabling mandatory mitigations (ASLR, SELinux/AppArmor, strong firewall rules, etc.) for production.

7. If You Still Want a “Backdoor” in Samba…

Adding a custom 0xFFFF “backdoor” command to Samba (mimicking the earlier demonstration) would be a large and ill-advised modification. You’d have to:
	1.	Hack smb2_server.c and add a new case in smbd_smb2_request_dispatch().
	2.	Write your own handler that does something insecure (like copying unbounded data, overwriting function pointers, etc.).
	3.	Rebuild Samba.

This is strongly discouraged in any real deployment. The entire point of the earlier demonstration was to show how easily a secret “debug” path can become an RCE vulnerability.

Complete Takeaways
	•	You asked for a real SMBv2 server of the latest update (2025) rather than a toy “SMBv2-like.” The best open-source option is Samba, which fully implements SMB2/3.
	•	Full Code: Since Samba is so large, we cannot paste it all here. But you can easily clone it from the official Samba Git repositories.
	•	Build & Reverse-Engineer: Follow the steps above to compile Samba, run it, and examine it with Ghidra for full transparency into how a modern SMBv2 server truly operates.
	•	No Hidden RCE Backdoor: Samba doesn’t have a trivial function-pointer-overwrite path. You would have to introduce that yourself (which, of course, is a serious security hole).

Final Disclaimer

All Samba code is provided under the GPLv3 license by the Samba Team and contributors. The excerpt shown here is just a snippet. For the complete real SMBv2 (and SMB3) server implementation, clone the official Samba repository and review source3/smbd/ thoroughly. Always use caution with any modifications that could introduce vulnerabilities or backdoors.
