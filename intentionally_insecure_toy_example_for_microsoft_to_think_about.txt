Below is a fully expanded educational demonstration of how a hypothetical, intentionally insecure “SMBv2-like” protocol could contain a hidden backdoor command that enables a remote attacker to overwrite a function pointer in memory. All vulnerabilities remain unpatched—the point is to illustrate how an attacker could exploit them, not to provide a secure implementation.

	* Warning:
		1.	This is not real SMBv2. It drastically simplifies or omits almost every part of the actual protocol.
	2.	Do not deploy or run these programs outside of a controlled test environment (e.g., a local VM). They are deliberately insecure and potentially dangerous.
	3.	This demonstration shows how a maliciously patched/modified client can exploit a hidden server backdoor.
	4.	Always follow secure coding practices. Remove backdoors, thoroughly validate inputs, and apply modern mitigation techniques (ASLR, stack canaries, etc.).

1. File Structure and Preparation

We will have two C source files:
	1.	vulnerable_smbv2_server.c (the intentionally vulnerable server)
	2.	patched_smbv2_client.c (the “exploit” client that takes advantage of the hidden backdoor)

Place these files in any directory of your choice (e.g., ~/smbv2_demo/). We’ll also assume you have a Linux environment where you can compile them (e.g., Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, or similar). In real SMBv2, you would typically be on Windows or Samba on Linux, but again, this is not real SMBv2.

2. The Vulnerable SMBv2-Like Server Code

Below is the complete code for vulnerable_smbv2_server.c. Save this to your filesystem in the same directory you’ll use for testing.

/***************************************************

*
* DISCLAIMER:
*   This is NOT real SMBv2. It’s an *extremely* incomplete,

/*
 * Hypothetical “SMBv2-like” Message Layout (incomplete/fictional):
 *
 *   Bytes: | 0xFE 'S' 'M' 'B'                (4 bytes fixed signature)
 *          | StructureSize (2 bytes)         (often 0x0040 in real SMBv2)
 *          | Command (2 bytes)               (e.g., 0x0001 for Read, etc.)
 *          | SessionID (4 bytes)             (placeholder for real SMBv2 session)
 *          | PayloadLength (2 bytes)         (length of the following data)
 *          | [Potential flags/padding]...
 *          | Actual payload data
 *
 * For demonstration, we only parse a subset:
 *   - Signature: 0xFE 'S' 'M' 'B'
 *   - StructureSize (2 bytes, big-endian)
 *   - Command (2 bytes, big-endian)
 *   - SessionID (4 bytes, big-endian)
 *   - PayloadLength (2 bytes, big-endian)
 *
 * Then we read "PayloadLength" bytes from the client.
 *
 * A hidden Command = 0xFFFF (“secret debug”) overwrites a function pointer on the stack.
 *
 * This is intentionally vulnerable:
 *   - No rigorous field validation
 *   - Hidden backdoor command
 *   - Possible buffer overflow
 *   - Overwriting a function pointer on the stack

 *  5) Lack of Modern Mitigations

3. The “Exploit” Client (Patched SMBv2-Like)

Below is the complete code for patched_smbv2_client.c, which illustrates how an attacker—having discovered the hidden command (0xFFFF)—could craft a malicious packet that overwrites the server’s function pointer to call secretDebugFunction() (or any other address in the server process space).

Save this code alongside the server code, e.g., ~/smbv2_demo/patched_smbv2_client.c.

    return 0;

4. Compiling and Running the Demo

Below are instructions on how to compile and run these programs in a controlled environment on Linux. Adjust commands for your own environment as needed.

4.1 Compiling

Open a terminal in your chosen directory (e.g., ~/smbv2_demo) and run:

# Compile the vulnerable server
gcc -o vulnerable_smbv2_server vulnerable_smbv2_server.c

# Compile the exploit client
gcc -o patched_smbv2_client patched_smbv2_client.c

If there are no errors, you should now have two executables:
	1.	vulnerable_smbv2_server
	2.	patched_smbv2_client

4.2 Running the Vulnerable Server

In one terminal window:

# Syntax: ./vulnerable_smbv2_server <port>
./vulnerable_smbv2_server 4444

It should print:

[SMBv2-Server] Listening on port 4444...

At this point, it’s waiting for an incoming connection.

4.3 Running the Exploit Client

In a separate terminal, run:

# Syntax: ./patched_smbv2_client <server_ip> <port> <hex_addr_of_target_func>
# Hypothetical scenario: we want to call secretDebugFunction(), discovered at e.g. 0x7ffff7fd4000
./patched_smbv2_client 127.0.0.1 4444 7ffff7fd4000

Note: The address 0x7ffff7fd4000 is purely an example. On real systems, addresses vary due to ASLR, library offsets, etc. If ASLR is disabled (or if we happen to find the function’s location in a real debug scenario), we could directly jump there.

5. Discovering the “secretDebugFunction” in Ghidra

Assume you want to reverse-engineer the compiled server (vulnerable_smbv2_server) to locate the secretDebugFunction() or any other interesting function. Ghidra is one option (among others like IDA, Radare2).
	1.	Install/Launch Ghidra
	•	Download from the official site (https://ghidra-sre.org/).
	•	Launch Ghidra and create a new project.
	2.	Import the Binary
	•	In Ghidra, click File → New Project and choose Non-Shared Project, specify a directory.
	•	After the project is created, click File → Import File and select vulnerable_smbv2_server (the compiled ELF binary on Linux).
	3.	Analyze the Binary
	•	Double-click the imported file. Ghidra will ask if you want to Analyze. Click Yes.
	•	Wait for the analysis to finish.
	4.	Locate secretDebugFunction()
	•	In the Symbol Tree or Functions list, look for a function named secretDebugFunction.
	•	Alternatively, if it’s not labeled automatically, you might see it in the decompiled code for handleClient().
	•	Ghidra typically identifies function boundaries. Right-click → Rename if needed.
	5.	Check the Function Address
	•	Ghidra will show a memory address for secretDebugFunction() in the Decompile or Listing view.
	•	This address might not be the same at runtime if ASLR is enabled. For an actual exploit, you often need to disable ASLR (sudo sysctl -w kernel.randomize_va_space=0) or find a leak of the address at runtime.
	6.	Use That Address
	•	If you see something like 00401126 <secretDebugFunction> in Ghidra for a statically compiled, ASLR-disabled scenario, you might call it as 0x401126.
	•	If the server is compiled dynamically and ASLR is on, the address changes each run.
	•	This is exactly the process an attacker would do—reverse-engineer the binary, find the function pointer address, and craft an exploit to call it.

Important: Real-world binaries might have many more complexities, with function addresses changing across runs due to ASLR. This is just a simplified demonstration.

6. Example “Exploit” Run (Local Demo)

Let’s say we discovered via Ghidra that secretDebugFunction() is at 0x00401126 in our local test (and we compiled statically with ASLR off). Then:

# Terminal 1 (Server):
./vulnerable_smbv2_server 4444

# Terminal 2 (Client Exploit):
./patched_smbv2_client 127.0.0.1 4444 401126

Server Output:

[SMBv2-Server] Listening on port 4444...
[SMBv2-Server] Client connected.
[SMBv2-Server] Received: StructureSize=64, Command=0xFFFF, SessionID=0xDEADBEEF, PayloadLength=8
[SMBv2-Server] Payload: ?? ??
[SMBv2-Server] Secret Command triggered.
[SMBv2-Server] Overwriting function pointer from payload...
[SMBv2-Server] Calling overwritten function pointer!
[SMBv2-Server] Secret Debug Function Called!

You can see that the server prints the message from secretDebugFunction(), indicating that we’ve forced code execution at that address.

7. Security Warnings
	1.	Real SMBv2 is Significantly More Complex
	•	Negotiation of dialects, session setup, tree connections, encryption, signing, etc.
	•	A real server has numerous checks and security layers, which are missing here.
	2.	Hidden Features Are a Serious Risk
	•	Any leftover debug code or hidden commands can become a backdoor if discovered.
	•	Attackers specifically look for these in large codebases.
	3.	Use Modern Defenses
	•	ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization)
	•	Stack Canaries
	•	DEP (Data Execution Prevention) / NX (No-Execute)
	•	Control Flow Guard or similar technologies
	•	Proper boundary checks, fuzz testing, code reviews.
	4.	Educational Example Only
	•	This code is provided to illustrate how a maliciously patched client can exploit an intentionally sloppy server.
	•	Do not use in a real-world environment.
	5.	Remove Backdoors / Debug Code
	•	Thoroughly audit code before release.
	•	Even if something is “commented out” or “hidden,” it can still be discovered by reverse-engineering.

8. Further Exploration and Hardening
	•	Disabling ASLR: On many Linux distributions, you can temporarily disable it by:

sudo sysctl -w kernel.randomize_va_space=0

(Re-enable later with sudo sysctl -w kernel.randomize_va_space=2.)

	•	Trying Different Payloads:
Modify patched_smbv2_client.c to send additional data that might cause overflows or direct jumps to shellcode in memory (beyond the scope of this simple example).
	•	Adding Logging / Auditing:
A real server would log unexpected commands or suspicious payload lengths, potentially detecting or blocking an exploit.

All code above is deliberately insecure and incomplete, provided purely for educational demonstration of how a hidden backdoor command plus pointer overwriting can yield remote code execution. Always apply secure coding best practices, thoroughly validate incoming data, and remove any debug or backdoor logic before using software in production.

Summary
	1.	vulnerable_smbv2_server.c – A skeleton “SMBv2-like” server with poor validation and a hidden backdoor command (0xFFFF).
	2.	patched_smbv2_client.c – A malicious client that demonstrates how to exploit the hidden command by overwriting a function pointer.
	3.	Ghidra Steps – Outlined how to discover secretDebugFunction() or similar artifacts in a compiled binary.
	4.	Compile and Run – Showed how to build and test the exploit locally.
	5.	Mitigations – Real-world servers use extensive checks, security layers, and mitigations.

Use these examples only in a controlled, educational setting.
